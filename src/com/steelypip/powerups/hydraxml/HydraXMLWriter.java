/**
 * Prints out a Fusion object to a {@link java.io.PrintWriter}. It can
 * be a simple-all-on-one-line or an elaborate pretty-printer depending
 * on the Indenter, and look like XML or JSON depending on the Theme that
 * is supplied.
 * 
 * The base theme is XML and for 0 children it looks like
 * 		< NAME KEY (=|+=) VALUE ... /> 
 * and for 1+ children
 * 		< NAME KEY=VALUE ... > [FIELD (=|+=)] CHILD ... </ NAME >
 * If the field name is omitted it is assumed to be "" and the
 * binding assumed to be +=. 
 * 
 * The JSON theme differs on "array" and "object" elements. When
 * when NAME is "array" and there are no attibutes, prefer
 * 		[ CHILD, ... ]
 * and when the NAME is "object" and there are no attributes and all
 * fields are single-valued, prefer
 * 		{ FIELD: CHILD, ... }
 * Note that in this case the field will be double-quoted.
 * 
 * The JSON theme also differs on literals:
 * 	When the name is "constant" and the only attributes are "type" whose
 *  value is "integer", "value" and optionally "radix", print as a literal
 *  integer - including transinteger values +/- infinity and nullity.
 *  When the name is "constant" and the only attributes are "type" whose
 *  value is "float", "value" and optionally "radix", print as a literal
 *  floating point number - including transreal values +/- infinity and nullity.
 * 	When the name is "constant" and the only attributes are "type" whose
 * 	value is "string" and "value", print as a double-quoted literal string. 
 * 	When the name is "constant" and the only attributes are "type" whose
 * 	value is "boolean" and "value", print as a boolean.
 *  When the name is "constant" and the only attributes are "type" whose
 *  value is "null" and optionally "value" whose value must be null, print
 *  as null.
 *  
 *  The FUSION theme differs from the XML by using the following format
 *  	< NAME KEY=VALUES ... FIELD:CHILDREN ... />
 *  where
 *  	VALUES ::= VALUE | '(' VALUE+ ')'
 *  	CHILDREN ::= CHILD | '(' CHILD+ ')'
 *  however it shares the literal printing with the JSON theme.
